# The Parable of the Lion's Cubs

## Biblical Text

"Take up a lament concerning the princes of Israel and say:

'What a lioness was your mother
    among the lions!
She lay down among them
    and reared her cubs.
She brought up one of her cubs,
    and he became a strong lion.
He learned to tear the prey
    and he became a man-eater.
The nations heard about him,
    and he was trapped in their pit.
They led him with hooks
    to the land of Egypt.

When she saw her hope unfulfilled,
    her expectation gone,
she took another of her cubs
    and made him a strong lion.
He prowled among the lions,
    for he was now a strong lion.
He learned to tear the prey
    and he became a man-eater.
He broke down their strongholds
    and devastated their towns.
The land and all who were in it
    were terrified by his roaring.
Then the nations came against him,
    those from regions round about.
They spread their net for him,
    and he was trapped in their pit.'"

â€” Ezekiel 19:1-8 (NIV)

## Context

This lament-parable describes the fate of two of Judah's last kings: Jehoahaz (taken to Egypt) and Jehoiachin (taken to Babylon). The lioness represents the nation of Judah, and her cubs are the royal sons who became kings.

## Theological Interpretation

This parable illustrates the tragic consequences of poor leadership and rebellion against God's ways. Using the metaphor of lion cubs, it shows how pride and aggression led to Judah's princes being captured by foreign powers, fulfilling God's judgment.
