# Isaiah's Vineyard Parable

I will sing for the one I love a song about his vineyard: My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside.

## Theological Interpretation

This parable illustrates God's disappointment with Israel, represented as an unproductive vineyard despite receiving His careful attention and cultivation.

## Practical Applications

1. God expects spiritual fruitfulness from His people
2. Privilege brings responsibility
3. Divine judgment follows persistent unfruitfulness

## Key Takeaways

- God's investment in His people
- The expectation of spiritual productivity
- Consequences of failing to respond to God's care
