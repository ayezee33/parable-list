# The Parable of the Pearl of Great Price

## Biblical Text

"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it."

â€” Matthew 13:45-46 (NIV)

## Context

Jesus told this parable immediately after the Hidden Treasure parable, reinforcing the theme of the kingdom's supreme worth. The merchant represents someone actively seeking truth, unlike the accidental discovery in the previous parable.

## Theological Interpretation

This parable emphasizes both the searching nature of faith and the supreme value of God's kingdom. Unlike the Hidden Treasure, this merchant was actively seeking, representing those who diligently search for truth. The willingness to sell everything shows that no earthly possession compares to the value of God's kingdom.

## Practical Applications
