# The Parable of the Leaven

## Biblical Text

He told them still another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough."

â€” Matthew 13:33 (NIV)

## Context

Jesus shared this parable immediately after the Mustard Seed parable, providing another illustration of how God's kingdom works in hidden but transformative ways.

## Theological Interpretation
