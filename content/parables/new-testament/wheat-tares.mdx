# The Parable of the Wheat and Tares

## Biblical Text

Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.

The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?'

'An enemy did this,' he replied.

The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'

'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'"

â€” Matthew 13:24-30 (NIV)

## Context

Jesus shared this parable as part of a series of kingdom parables, teaching about the nature of God's kingdom and its development in the world. It addresses the disciples' questions about why evil continues to exist alongside good in the world.

## Theological Interpretation

This parable teaches about the coexistence of good and evil in the world until the final judgment. It reveals God's patience in dealing with evil and His wisdom in allowing both to grow together until the proper time of separation, preventing damage to the righteous during premature judgment.

## Practical Applications

**1. Divine Patience**
- God has reasons for allowing evil to persist
- Final judgment comes at the proper time

**2. Spiritual Discernment**

- The importance of waiting for full manifestation

**3. Kingdom Growth**
- The reality of opposition to God's work
- The certainty of final separation
- Patient endurance in the face of evil

## Key Takeaways

- God's kingdom contains both true and false believers until the end
- Premature judgment can harm the growth of true believers
- Final judgment brings complete separation and justice
