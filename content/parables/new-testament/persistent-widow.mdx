# The Parable of the Persistent Widow

## Biblical Text

Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. He said: "In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, 'Grant me justice against my adversary.'

For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, 'Even though I don't fear God or care what people think, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually come and attack me!'

And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"

â€” Luke 18:1-8 (NIV)

## Context

Jesus told this parable to encourage His disciples to persist in prayer and maintain faith, even when answers seem delayed. It comes in a section of Luke's Gospel focusing on prayer and faithfulness.

## Theological Interpretation

This parable teaches about the nature of prayer and God's character through contrast. If an unjust judge will eventually grant justice due to persistence, how much more will a loving God respond to His children's prayers? It emphasizes both the importance of persistent prayer and God's readiness to answer.
