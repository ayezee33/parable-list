# The Parable of the Two Sons

## Biblical Text

"What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'

'I will not,' he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.

Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, 'I will, sir,' but he did not go.

Which of the two did what his father wanted?"

"The first," they answered.

Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him."

â€” Matthew 21:28-32 (NIV)

## Context

Jesus told this parable to the chief priests and elders who questioned His authority. It directly challenged their self-righteousness and highlighted the importance of genuine repentance over mere religious profession.

## Theological Interpretation

This parable contrasts outward profession with actual obedience, showing that genuine repentance and changed behavior matter more than empty promises. It illustrates how those considered spiritual outcasts can enter God's kingdom ahead of religious leaders through genuine repentance.
