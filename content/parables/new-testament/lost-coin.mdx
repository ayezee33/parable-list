# The Parable of the Lost Coin

## Biblical Text

"Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Doesn't she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?

And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.'

In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."

â€” Luke 15:8-10 (NIV)

## Context

This is the second in Jesus' trilogy of "lost" parables, following the Lost Sheep and preceding the Prodigal Son. Jesus continues to defend His ministry to tax collectors and sinners, using everyday examples His audience would understand.

## Theological Interpretation

This parable emphasizes God's thorough and persistent search for the lost. The woman's diligent effort to find one coin illustrates God's focused attention on each individual soul. The celebration upon finding the coin reveals heaven's joy when even one person returns to God.
