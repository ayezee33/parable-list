# The Parable of the Dragnet

## Biblical Text

"Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

â€” Matthew 13:47-50 (NIV)

## Context

Jesus shared this parable as part of His series of kingdom parables in Matthew 13. It comes as a sobering reminder about the final judgment, following parables about the kingdom's growth and value.

## Theological Interpretation

This parable illustrates the reality of final judgment and separation in God's kingdom. While the kingdom's net draws in all types of people, there will be an ultimate sorting between the righteous and unrighteous. The parable emphasizes both the kingdom's inclusiveness in gathering and its exclusiveness in final judgment.
