# The Parable of the Lost Sheep

## Biblical Text

Then Jesus told them this parable: "Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn't he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?

And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.'

I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent."

â€” Luke 15:3-7 (NIV)

## Context

Jesus shared this parable in response to the Pharisees and teachers of the law who were criticizing Him for welcoming and eating with sinners. It's the first in a series of three parables about God's heart for the lost.

## Theological Interpretation

This parable reveals God's passionate pursuit of lost sinners and His great joy in their salvation. The shepherd's dedication to finding one lost sheep, even leaving the ninety-nine, demonstrates God's personal care for each individual and His commitment to seeking those who have strayed.
