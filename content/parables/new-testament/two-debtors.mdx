# The Parable of the Two Debtors

## Biblical Text

"Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"

Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven."

"You have judged correctly," Jesus said.

â€” Luke 7:41-43 (NIV)

## Context

Jesus told this parable at a Pharisee's house when a sinful woman anointed His feet. The parable responds to Simon the Pharisee's judgmental attitude toward the woman and his failure to show basic hospitality to Jesus.

## Theological Interpretation

This parable illustrates the relationship between forgiveness and love. It shows that those who recognize the magnitude of their forgiveness often respond with greater love and gratitude. The parable challenges self-righteousness while affirming the connection between receiving mercy and showing love.
