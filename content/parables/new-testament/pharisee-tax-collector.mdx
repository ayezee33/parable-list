# The Parable of the Pharisee and Tax Collector

## Biblical Text

To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: "Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'

But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'

I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."

— Luke 18:9-14 (NIV)

## Context

Jesus told this parable to address those who trusted in their own righteousness and looked down on others. It follows the parable of the Persistent Widow and continues Luke's theme of proper prayer.

## Theological Interpretation

This parable contrasts self-righteous religion with true repentance. It demonstrates that justification comes through humble acknowledgment of sin and need for mercy, not through self-proclaimed righteousness or religious achievements.
