# The Parable of the Sower

## Biblical Text

That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. Then he told them many things in parables, saying:

"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.

Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.

Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.

Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.

Whoever has ears, let them hear."

— Matthew 13:1-9 (NIV)

## Context

This is one of Jesus' most foundational parables, explaining how people respond differently to God's word. It's one of the few parables where Jesus also provides a detailed interpretation to His disciples, helping them understand the various responses to the gospel message.

## Theological Interpretation

This parable illustrates how the same gospel message produces different results in different hearts. The seed represents God's Word, while the different soils represent various heart conditions and responses to that Word. The emphasis is both on the generous sowing of the seed and the importance of being good soil.
