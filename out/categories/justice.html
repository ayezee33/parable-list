The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle, but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him.\n\u003e\n\u003e \"Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him.

Act like a woman who has spent many days grieving for the dead.\"\n\nThen the woman said, \"Please let me speak a word to my lord the king.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" he replied.\n\nThe woman said, \"I am a widow; my husband is dead. I your servant had two sons. They got into a fight with each other in the field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him. Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant; they say, 'Hand over the one who struck his brother down, so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed; then we will get rid of the heir as well.'

He said: \"In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, 'Grant me justice against my adversary.'\n\nFor some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, 'Even though I don't fear God or care what people think, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually come and attack me!'\n\nAnd the Lord said, \"Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?\"\n\n— Luke 18:1-8 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable to encourage His disciples to persist in prayer and maintain faith, even when answers seem delayed. It comes in a section of Luke's Gospel focusing on prayer and faithfulness.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable teaches about the nature of prayer and God's character through contrast. If an unjust judge will eventually grant justice due to persistence, how much more will a loving God respond to His children's prayers?
