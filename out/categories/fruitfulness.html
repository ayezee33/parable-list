Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on?\n\nAnd after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything? If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred?\n\nTherefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem. I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them.

Then he told them many things in parables, saying:\n\n\"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.\n\nSome fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.\n\nOther seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.\n\nStill other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.\n\nWhoever has ears, let them hear.\"\n\n— Matthew 13:1-9 (NIV)","context":"This is one of Jesus' most foundational parables, explaining how people respond differently to God's word.
