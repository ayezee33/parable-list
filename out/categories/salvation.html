The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.\n\nWhen he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice...\n\nI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away...\n\nI am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me—just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep.\"\n\n— John 10:1-5, 11-12, 14-15 (NIV)","context":"Jesus spoke this parable following His healing of a blind man and the subsequent controversy with the Pharisees.

If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.\n\nYou will say then, \"Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.\" Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble. For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.\n\nConsider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.\n\nAfter all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!\n\n— Romans 11:16-24 (NIV)","context":"Paul uses this agricultural metaphor to explain the relationship between Jews and Gentiles in God's plan of salvation, addressing Gentile believers who might be tempted to feel superior to unbelieving Jews.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates God's sovereign work in salvation history, showing how Gentiles have been included in God's covenant promises to Israel.
