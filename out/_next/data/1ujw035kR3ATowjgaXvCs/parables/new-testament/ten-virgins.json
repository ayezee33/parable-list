Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps.\n\nThe bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.\n\nAt midnight the cry rang out: 'Here's the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'\n\nThen all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.'\n\n'No,' they replied, 'there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.'\n\nBut while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.\n\nLater the others also came. 'Lord, Lord,' they said, 'open the door for us!' But he replied, 'Truly I tell you, I don't know you.'\n\nTherefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.\"\n\nâ€” Matthew 25:1-13 (NIV)","context":"Jesus shared this parable near the end of His ministry as part of His teaching about His second coming and the end times. It emphasizes the importance of spiritual preparedness and perseverance.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates the necessity of personal spiritual readiness for Christ's return. The oil represents genuine spiritual preparation that cannot be borrowed or acquired at the last moment. It warns against presuming upon future opportunities for spiritual preparation.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Personal Preparation","points":["Faith must be personal","Preparation can't be borrowed","Readiness requires foresight"]},{"title":"Spiritual Wisdom","points":["Plan for the long term","Don't rely on others' faith","Maintain spiritual reserves"]},{"title":"Eternal Consequences","points":["Opportunities have limits","Delayed preparation risks exclusion","Some decisions can't be reversed"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Spiritual preparation is personal","Readiness must be maintained","Delayed response risks exclusion"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"wedding-feast","title":"The Wedding Feast","reference":"Matthew 22:1-14","theme":"readiness"},{"id":"faithful-servant","title":"The Faithful Servant","reference":"Matthew 24:45-51","theme":"watchfulness"},{"id":"talents","title":"The Talents","reference":"Matthew 25:14-30","theme":"stewardship"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
