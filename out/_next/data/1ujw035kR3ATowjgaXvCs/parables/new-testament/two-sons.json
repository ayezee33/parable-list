There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'\n\n'I will not,' he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.\n\nThen the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, 'I will, sir,' but he did not go.\n\nWhich of the two did what his father wanted?\"\n\n\"The first,\" they answered.\n\nJesus said to them, \"Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.\"\n\nâ€” Matthew 21:28-32 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable to the chief priests and elders who questioned His authority. It directly challenged their self-righteousness and highlighted the importance of genuine repentance over mere religious profession.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable contrasts outward profession with actual obedience, showing that genuine repentance and changed behavior matter more than empty promises. It illustrates how those considered spiritual outcasts can enter God's kingdom ahead of religious leaders through genuine repentance.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"True Obedience","points":["Actions speak louder than words","Changed behavior shows repentance","Initial resistance can change"]},{"title":"Religious Hypocrisy","points":["Saying isn't doing","Promises require action","Appearance isn't reality"]},{"title":"Genuine Repentance","points":["Change is always possible","God values sincere response","Past decisions can be reversed"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Genuine obedience matters more than words","Repentance is shown through actions","Religious profession without obedience is worthless"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"pharisee-and-tax-collector","title":"The Pharisee and Tax Collector","reference":"Luke 18:9-14","theme":"true repentance"},{"id":"good-samaritan","title":"The Good Samaritan","reference":"Luke 10:25-37","theme":"true obedience"},{"id":"rich-young-ruler","title":"The Rich Young Ruler","reference":"Matthew 19:16-30","theme":"genuine commitment"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
