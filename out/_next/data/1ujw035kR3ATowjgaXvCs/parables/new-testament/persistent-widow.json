He said: \"In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, 'Grant me justice against my adversary.'\n\nFor some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, 'Even though I don't fear God or care what people think, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually come and attack me!'\n\nAnd the Lord said, \"Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?\"\n\nâ€” Luke 18:1-8 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable to encourage His disciples to persist in prayer and maintain faith, even when answers seem delayed. It comes in a section of Luke's Gospel focusing on prayer and faithfulness.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable teaches about the nature of prayer and God's character through contrast. If an unjust judge will eventually grant justice due to persistence, how much more will a loving God respond to His children's prayers? It emphasizes both the importance of persistent prayer and God's readiness to answer.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Prayer Persistence","points":["Never give up praying","Consistency matters","Faith requires endurance"]},{"title":"Divine Justice","points":["God hears His people","Justice will come","Trust God's timing"]},{"title":"Faith Development","points":["Delays test faith","Persistence reveals faith","Prayer builds character"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Persistent prayer demonstrates faith","God responds to faithful prayer","Justice will ultimately prevail"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"friend-at-midnight","title":"The Friend at Midnight","reference":"Luke 11:5-8","theme":"persistence"},{"id":"pharisee-and-tax-collector","title":"The Pharisee and Tax Collector","reference":"Luke 18:9-14","theme":"prayer"},{"id":"unjust-steward","title":"The Unjust Steward","reference":"Luke 16:1-8","theme":"persistence"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
