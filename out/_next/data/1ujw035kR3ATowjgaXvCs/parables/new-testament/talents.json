To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.\n\nThe man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.\n\nAfter a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.'\n\nHis master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'\n\nThe man with two bags of gold also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.'\n\nHis master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'\n\nThen the man who had received one bag of gold came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'\n\nHis master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.'\"\n\nâ€” Matthew 25:14-27 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable near the end of His ministry as part of His teaching about His return and final judgment. It follows the Parable of the Ten Virgins and continues the theme of readiness for the Master's return.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable teaches about faithful stewardship of God's gifts and the accountability that comes with them. It emphasizes that God gives according to ability, expects productive use of His gifts, and will judge based on faithfulness rather than equal results.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Faithful Stewardship","points":["All gifts come from God","Different people receive different amounts","Faithfulness matters more than amount"]},{"title":"Active Service","points":["Taking initiative with what we're given","Avoiding fear","based inaction","Using resources for God's purposes"]},{"title":"Future Accountability","points":["Everyone must give account","Rewards come from faithfulness","Excuses won't justify inaction"]}],"keyTakeaways":["God entrusts according to ability","Faithful service brings greater responsibility","Fear and laziness are unacceptable responses"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"minas","title":"The Minas","reference":"Luke 19:11-27","theme":"stewardship"},{"id":"rich-fool","title":"The Rich Fool","reference":"Luke 12:16-21","theme":"responsibility"},{"id":"faithful-servant","title":"The Faithful Servant","reference":"Matthew 24:45-51","theme":"accountability"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
