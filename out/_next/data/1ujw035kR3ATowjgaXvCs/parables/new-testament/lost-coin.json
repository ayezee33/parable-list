Doesn't she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?\n\nAnd when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.'\n\nIn the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\"\n\nâ€” Luke 15:8-10 (NIV)","context":"This is the second in Jesus' trilogy of \"lost\" parables, following the Lost Sheep and preceding the Prodigal Son.
