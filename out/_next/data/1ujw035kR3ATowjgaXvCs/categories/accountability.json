To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.\n\nThe man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.\n\nAfter a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.'\n\nHis master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'\n\nThe man with two bags of gold also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.'\n\nHis master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'\n\nThen the man who had received one bag of gold came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'\n\nHis master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.'\"\n\n— Matthew 25:14-27 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable near the end of His ministry as part of His teaching about His return and final judgment. It follows the Parable of the Ten Virgins and continues the theme of readiness for the Master's return.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable teaches about faithful stewardship of God's gifts and the accountability that comes with them. It emphasizes that God gives according to ability, expects productive use of His gifts, and will judge based on faithfulness rather than equal results.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Faithful Stewardship","points":["All gifts come from God","Different people receive different amounts","Faithfulness matters more than amount"]},{"title":"Active Service","points":["Taking initiative with what we're given","Avoiding fear","based inaction","Using resources for God's purposes"]},{"title":"Future Accountability","points":["Everyone must give account","Rewards come from faithfulness","Excuses won't justify inaction"]}],"keyTakeaways":["God entrusts according to ability","Faithful service brings greater responsibility","Fear and laziness are unacceptable responses"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"minas","title":"The Minas","reference":"Luke 19:11-27","theme":"stewardship"},{"id":"rich-fool","title":"The Rich Fool","reference":"Luke 12:16-21","theme":"responsibility"},{"id":"faithful-servant","title":"The Faithful Servant","reference":"Matthew 24:45-51","theme":"accountability"}]},{"id":"wicked-tenants","title":"Parable of the Wicked Tenants","bibleReference":{"book":"Matthew","chapter":21,"verse":"33-46"},"categories":["judgment","rejection","accountability"],"tags":["parables of jesus","kingdom of heaven","israel"],"testament":"new","biblicalText":"\"Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.\n\nThe tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way. Last of all, he sent his son to them. 'They will respect my son,' he said.\n\nBut when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance.' So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.\n\nTherefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?\"\n\n\"He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,\" they replied, \"and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.\"\n\n— Matthew 21:33-41 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable during His final week in Jerusalem, addressing the religious leaders who were plotting against Him. It clearly portrayed Israel's history of rejecting God's prophets and foreshadowed their rejection of Jesus Himself.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates Israel's repeated rejection of God's messengers and ultimately His Son. The vineyard represents Israel, the tenants are the religious leaders, the servants are the prophets, and the son represents Jesus. It warns of judgment for rejecting God's Son and the transfer of kingdom privileges to others.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Divine Investment","points":["God provides everything needed","Privilege brings responsibility","Resources are for God's purposes"]},{"title":"Persistent Rebellion","points":["Rejection of divine authority","Escalating disobedience","Hardened hearts"]},{"title":"Divine Justice","points":["Accountability is certain","Rejection brings judgment","Kingdom opportunities transfer"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Rejecting God's Son brings judgment","Privilege requires responsibility","God's purpose prevails despite opposition"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"vineyard-workers","title":"The Vineyard Workers","reference":"Matthew 20:1-16","theme":"divine authority"},{"id":"two-sons","title":"The Two Sons","reference":"Matthew 21:28-32","theme":"obedience"},{"id":"wedding-feast","title":"The Wedding Feast","reference":"Matthew 22:1-14","theme":"rejection"}]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
