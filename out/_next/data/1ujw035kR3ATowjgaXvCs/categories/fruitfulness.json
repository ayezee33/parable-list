Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on?\n\nAnd after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything? If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred?\n\nTherefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem. I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the Lord.\"\n\n— Ezekiel 15:1-7 (NIV)","context":"Ezekiel delivered this parable during the Babylonian exile to illustrate Jerusalem's uselessness when failing its divine purpose. The vine represents Israel, traditionally God's chosen vineyard, now failing to produce fruit.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates the importance of fulfilling divine purpose. Unlike other trees valued for their wood, a vine's only value is in its fruit. When God's people fail their purpose of bearing spiritual fruit, they become worthless like an unproductive vine.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Divine Purpose","points":["Every life has a purpose","Value comes from fulfilling purpose","Fruitlessness brings judgment"]},{"title":"Spiritual Productivity","points":["God expects fruit","No alternative purpose suffices","Grace requires response"]},{"title":"Judgment Warning","points":["Failure has consequences","God's patience has limits","Repentance brings restoration"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Purpose determines value","Fruitlessness invites judgment","God expects spiritual productivity"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"song-of-the-vineyard","title":"The Song of the Vineyard","reference":"Isaiah 5:1-7","theme":"fruitfulness"},{"id":"two-eagles","title":"The Two Eagles","reference":"Ezekiel 17:1-10","theme":"divine judgment"},{"id":"true-vine","title":"The True Vine","reference":"John 15:1-8","theme":"spiritual productivity"}]},{"id":"song-vineyard","title":"Song of the Vineyard","bibleReference":{"book":"Isaiah","chapter":5,"verse":"1-7"},"categories":["judgment","faithfulness","fruitfulness"],"tags":["old testament parables","prophecy","vineyard"],"testament":"old","biblicalText":"I will sing for the one I love a song about his vineyard:\nMy loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside.\nHe dug it up and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vines.\nHe built a watchtower in it and cut out a winepress as well.\nThen he looked for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad fruit.\n\n\"Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and people of Judah,\njudge between me and my vineyard.\nWhat more could have been done for my vineyard than I have done for it?\nWhen I looked for good grapes, why did it yield only bad?\n\nNow I will tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard:\nI will take away its hedge, and it will be destroyed;\nI will break down its wall, and it will be trampled.\nI will make it a wasteland, neither pruned nor cultivated,\nand briers and thorns will grow there.\nI will command the clouds not to rain on it.\"\n\nThe vineyard of the Lord Almighty is the nation of Israel,\nand the people of Judah are the vines he delighted in.\nAnd he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed;\nfor righteousness, but heard cries of distress.\n\n— Isaiah 5:1-7 (NIV)","context":"Isaiah delivered this love song turned lament during a time of relative prosperity in Judah, warning of coming judgment due to their failure to produce the fruit of righteousness despite God's careful cultivation.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable portrays God as a diligent vineyard keeper who has done everything possible to produce good fruit from His people.

Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. Then he told them many things in parables, saying:\n\n\"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.\n\nSome fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.\n\nOther seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.\n\nStill other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.\n\nWhoever has ears, let them hear.\"\n\n— Matthew 13:1-9 (NIV)","context":"This is one of Jesus' most foundational parables, explaining how people respond differently to God's word. It's one of the few parables where Jesus also provides a detailed interpretation to His disciples, helping them understand the various responses to the gospel message.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates how the same gospel message produces different results in different hearts. The seed represents God's Word, while the different soils represent various heart conditions and responses to that Word.
