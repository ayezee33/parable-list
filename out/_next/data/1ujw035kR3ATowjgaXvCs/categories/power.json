It was given two months before Jerusalem's fall, warning Egypt about the dangers of pride and the certainty of divine judgment.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates how pride leads to downfall. Using the metaphor of a majestic cedar tree, it shows how nations that exalt themselves will be humbled by God.
