He said: \"In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, 'Grant me justice against my adversary.'\n\nFor some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, 'Even though I don't fear God or care what people think, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually come and attack me!'\n\nAnd the Lord said, \"Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?\"\n\n— Luke 18:1-8 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable to encourage His disciples to persist in prayer and maintain faith, even when answers seem delayed. It comes in a section of Luke's Gospel focusing on prayer and faithfulness.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable teaches about the nature of prayer and God's character through contrast. If an unjust judge will eventually grant justice due to persistence, how much more will a loving God respond to His children's prayers? It emphasizes both the importance of persistent prayer and God's readiness to answer.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Prayer Persistence","points":["Never give up praying","Consistency matters","Faith requires endurance"]},{"title":"Divine Justice","points":["God hears His people","Justice will come","Trust God's timing"]},{"title":"Faith Development","points":["Delays test faith","Persistence reveals faith","Prayer builds character"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Persistent prayer demonstrates faith","God responds to faithful prayer","Justice will ultimately prevail"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"friend-at-midnight","title":"The Friend at Midnight","reference":"Luke 11:5-8","theme":"persistence"},{"id":"pharisee-and-tax-collector","title":"The Pharisee and Tax Collector","reference":"Luke 18:9-14","theme":"prayer"},{"id":"unjust-steward","title":"The Unjust Steward","reference":"Luke 16:1-8","theme":"persistence"}]},{"id":"pharisee-tax-collector","title":"Parable of the Pharisee and Tax Collector","bibleReference":{"book":"Luke","chapter":18,"verse":"9-14"},"categories":["humility","prayer","repentance"],"tags":["parables of jesus","pride","justification"],"testament":"new","biblicalText":"To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: \"Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'\n\nBut the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'\n\nI tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\"\n\n— Luke 18:9-14 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable to address those who trusted in their own righteousness and looked down on others. It follows the parable of the Persistent Widow and continues Luke's theme of proper prayer.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable contrasts self-righteous religion with true repentance. It demonstrates that justification comes through humble acknowledgment of sin and need for mercy, not through self-proclaimed righteousness or religious achievements.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"True Prayer","points":["Humility before God","Honest self","assessment","Recognition of need"]},{"title":"False Religion","points":["Danger of self","righteousness","Comparing with others","Pride in performance"]},{"title":"Divine Acceptance","points":["God values humility","Mercy trumps merit","Grace for the repentant"]}],"keyTakeaways":["God accepts humble repentance","Self","righteousness blocks grace","True prayer begins with humility"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"persistent-widow","title":"The Persistent Widow","reference":"Luke 18:1-8","theme":"prayer"},{"id":"two-sons","title":"The Two Sons","reference":"Matthew 21:28-32","theme":"true repentance"},{"id":"unmerciful-servant","title":"The Unmerciful Servant","reference":"Matthew 18:21-35","theme":"mercy"}]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
