Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on?\n\nAnd after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything? If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred?\n\nTherefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem. I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the Lord.\"\n\nâ€” Ezekiel 15:1-7 (NIV)","context":"Ezekiel delivered this parable during the Babylonian exile to illustrate Jerusalem's uselessness when failing its divine purpose. The vine represents Israel, traditionally God's chosen vineyard, now failing to produce fruit.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates the importance of fulfilling divine purpose. Unlike other trees valued for their wood, a vine's only value is in its fruit. When God's people fail their purpose of bearing spiritual fruit, they become worthless like an unproductive vine.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Divine Purpose","points":["Every life has a purpose","Value comes from fulfilling purpose","Fruitlessness brings judgment"]},{"title":"Spiritual Productivity","points":["God expects fruit","No alternative purpose suffices","Grace requires response"]},{"title":"Judgment Warning","points":["Failure has consequences","God's patience has limits","Repentance brings restoration"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Purpose determines value","Fruitlessness invites judgment","God expects spiritual productivity"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"song-of-the-vineyard","title":"The Song of the Vineyard","reference":"Isaiah 5:1-7","theme":"fruitfulness"},{"id":"two-eagles","title":"The Two Eagles","reference":"Ezekiel 17:1-10","theme":"divine judgment"},{"id":"true-vine","title":"The True Vine","reference":"John 15:1-8","theme":"spiritual productivity"}]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
