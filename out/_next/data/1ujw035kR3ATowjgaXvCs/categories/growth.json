A man scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.\n\nAll by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.\n\nAs soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.\"\n\n— Mark 4:26-29 (NIV)","context":"Jesus shared this parable alongside other agricultural parables about God's kingdom. It appears only in Mark's gospel and emphasizes the mysterious, autonomous nature of spiritual growth.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates how God's kingdom grows by divine power rather than human effort. While humans participate by sowing the seed, the actual growth process is mysterious and governed by God.

Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. Then he told them many things in parables, saying:\n\n\"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.\n\nSome fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.\n\nOther seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.\n\nStill other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.\n\nWhoever has ears, let them hear.\"\n\n— Matthew 13:1-9 (NIV)","context":"This is one of Jesus' most foundational parables, explaining how people respond differently to God's word. It's one of the few parables where Jesus also provides a detailed interpretation to His disciples, helping them understand the various responses to the gospel message.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates how the same gospel message produces different results in different hearts. The seed represents God's Word, while the different soils represent various heart conditions and responses to that Word.
