One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?\"\n\nSimon replied, \"I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.\"\n\n\"You have judged correctly,\" Jesus said.\n\nâ€” Luke 7:41-43 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable at a Pharisee's house when a sinful woman anointed His feet. The parable responds to Simon the Pharisee's judgmental attitude toward the woman and his failure to show basic hospitality to Jesus.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates the relationship between forgiveness and love. It shows that those who recognize the magnitude of their forgiveness often respond with greater love and gratitude. The parable challenges self-righteousness while affirming the connection between receiving mercy and showing love.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Recognition of Debt","points":["All are debtors to God's grace","Self","righteousness blinds us to our need","Honest assessment leads to gratitude"]},{"title":"Grace and Response","points":["Forgiveness produces love","Greater awareness leads to greater gratitude","Love flows from received mercy"]},{"title":"Heart Examination","points":["Comparing our response to mercy","Avoiding self","righteous judgment","Cultivating grateful love"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Those forgiven much, love much","Self","righteousness hinders gratitude","Recognition of grace produces love"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"unmerciful-servant","title":"The Unmerciful Servant","reference":"Matthew 18:23-35","theme":"forgiveness"},{"id":"pharisee-and-tax-collector","title":"The Pharisee and Tax Collector","reference":"Luke 18:9-14","theme":"humility"},{"id":"prodigal-son","title":"The Prodigal Son","reference":"Luke 15:11-32","theme":"grace and restoration"}]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
