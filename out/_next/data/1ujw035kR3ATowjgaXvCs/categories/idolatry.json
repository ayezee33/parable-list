They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth...\n\nThe older was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.\n\nOholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine; and she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians—warriors clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, and mounted horsemen...\n\nHer sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister... Therefore I will deliver her into the hands of her lovers, the Assyrians, for whom she lusted.\"\n\n— Ezekiel 23:1-9, 11, 9 (NIV)","context":"Ezekiel used this extended allegory to describe the spiritual unfaithfulness of both the northern kingdom (Samaria/Oholah) and the southern kingdom (Jerusalem/Oholibah). It portrays their pursuit of political alliances and idolatry as spiritual adultery.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable dramatically illustrates God's perspective on spiritual unfaithfulness. Using the metaphor of marriage and adultery, it shows how Israel and Judah's political alliances and idolatry violated their covenant relationship with God.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Covenant Faithfulness","points":["God desires exclusive devotion","Divided loyalty is spiritual adultery","Past judgment should warn us"]},{"title":"False Security","points":["Worldly alliances bring danger","Trust in God alone","Learn from others' mistakes"]},{"title":"Divine Justice","points":["Sin brings consequences","God judges unfaithfulness","Judgment fits the crime"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Spiritual unfaithfulness grieves God deeply","Political compromise often leads to spiritual compromise","God judges persistent unfaithfulness"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"unfaithful-wife","title":"The Unfaithful Wife","reference":"Hosea 1-3","theme":"spiritual adultery"},{"id":"two-eagles","title":"The Two Eagles","reference":"Ezekiel 17","theme":"political alliances"},{"id":"boiling-pot","title":"The Boiling Pot","reference":"Ezekiel 24","theme":"judgment"}]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
