The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.\n\nWhen he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice...\n\nI am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away...\n\nI am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me—just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep.\"\n\n— John 10:1-5, 11-12, 14-15 (NIV)","context":"Jesus spoke this parable following His healing of a blind man and the subsequent controversy with the Pharisees. It contrasts His loving leadership with the false shepherds of Israel who failed to care for God's people.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable reveals Jesus as the true shepherd of God's people, willing to sacrifice Himself for their salvation. It emphasizes the intimate relationship between Christ and His followers, and His unique role in providing eternal life through His sacrificial death.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Divine Leadership","points":["Christ knows His people personally","True authority serves sacrificially","Relationship precedes following"]},{"title":"Spiritual Discernment","points":["Recognize Christ's voice","Avoid false teachers","Follow authentic leadership"]},{"title":"Sacrificial Love","points":["True leadership costs","Protection requires commitment","Love demands sacrifice"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Jesus is the only true spiritual shepherd","Genuine leadership involves sacrifice","Intimate relationship marks true faith"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"lost-sheep","title":"The Lost Sheep","reference":"Luke 15:3-7","theme":"pastoral care"},{"id":"faithful-servant","title":"The Faithful Servant","reference":"Luke 12:42-48","theme":"leadership"},{"id":"hired-hand","title":"The Hired Hand","reference":"John 10:12-13","theme":"false leadership"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
