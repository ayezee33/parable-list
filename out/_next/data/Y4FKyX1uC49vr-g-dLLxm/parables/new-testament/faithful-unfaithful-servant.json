It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.\n\nBut suppose the servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time in coming,' and he then begins to beat the other servants, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk. The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.\n\nThe servant who knows the master's will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows. But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.\"\n\nâ€” Luke 12:41-48 (NIV)","context":"This parable follows the Watchful Servants parable and expands on the theme of faithful service, specifically addressing those in positions of leadership and responsibility in God's kingdom.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable teaches about the responsibility that comes with spiritual knowledge and authority.
