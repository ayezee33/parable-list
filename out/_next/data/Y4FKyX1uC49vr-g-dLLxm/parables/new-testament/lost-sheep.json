Doesn't he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?\n\nAnd when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.'\n\nI tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.\"\n\nâ€” Luke 15:3-7 (NIV)","context":"Jesus shared this parable in response to the Pharisees and teachers of the law who were criticizing Him for welcoming and eating with sinners. It's the first in a series of three parables about God's heart for the lost.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable reveals God's passionate pursuit of lost sinners and His great joy in their salvation. The shepherd's dedication to finding one lost sheep, even leaving the ninety-nine, demonstrates God's personal care for each individual and His commitment to seeking those who have strayed.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Divine Initiative","points":["God actively seeks the lost","Every individual matters to God","Salvation begins with God's pursuit"]},{"title":"Sacrificial Love","points":["Seeking the lost requires effort","One is worth leaving the ninety","nine","Recovery brings great joy"]},{"title":"Community Celebration","points":["Salvation is cause for rejoicing","The community shares in God's joy","Heaven celebrates repentance"]}],"keyTakeaways":["God personally pursues those who are lost","Every individual has infinite worth to God","Repentance brings heavenly celebration"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"lost-coin","title":"The Lost Coin","reference":"Luke 15:8-10","theme":"diligent seeking"},{"id":"prodigal-son","title":"The Prodigal Son","reference":"Luke 15:11-32","theme":"joyful return"},{"id":"good-shepherd","title":"The Good Shepherd","reference":"John 10:1-18","theme":"shepherd's care"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
