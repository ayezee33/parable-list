The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'\n\nBut the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'\n\nI tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\"\n\n— Luke 18:9-14 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable to address those who trusted in their own righteousness and looked down on others. It follows the parable of the Persistent Widow and continues Luke's theme of proper prayer.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable contrasts self-righteous religion with true repentance. It demonstrates that justification comes through humble acknowledgment of sin and need for mercy, not through self-proclaimed righteousness or religious achievements.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"True Prayer","points":["Humility before God","Honest self","assessment","Recognition of need"]},{"title":"False Religion","points":["Danger of self","righteousness","Comparing with others","Pride in performance"]},{"title":"Divine Acceptance","points":["God values humility","Mercy trumps merit","Grace for the repentant"]}],"keyTakeaways":["God accepts humble repentance","Self","righteousness blocks grace","True prayer begins with humility"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"persistent-widow","title":"The Persistent Widow","reference":"Luke 18:1-8","theme":"prayer"},{"id":"two-sons","title":"The Two Sons","reference":"Matthew 21:28-32","theme":"true repentance"},{"id":"unmerciful-servant","title":"The Unmerciful Servant","reference":"Matthew 18:21-35","theme":"mercy"}]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
