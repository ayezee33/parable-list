So he called him in and asked him, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.'\n\nThe manager said to himself, 'What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg. I know what I'll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.'\n\nSo he called in each one of his master's debtors. He asked the first, 'How much do you owe my master?' 'Nine hundred gallons of olive oil,' he replied. The manager told him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.' Then he asked the second, 'And how much do you owe?' 'A thousand bushels of wheat,' he replied. He told him, 'Take your bill and make it eight hundred.'\n\nThe master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light. I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.\"\n\n— Luke 16:1-9 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable to His disciples, teaching about the proper use of material resources. It's one of the most challenging parables to interpret, as it appears to commend dishonest behavior.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable isn't endorsing dishonesty but rather highlighting the importance of using worldly resources wisely for eternal purposes. The manager is commended not for his dishonesty but for his shrewd planning for the future, encouraging believers to be equally wise in using material resources for spiritual purposes.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Strategic Stewardship","points":["Use resources wisely","Plan for eternity","Act with foresight"]},{"title":"Kingdom Priorities","points":["Eternal perspective matters","Material wealth is temporary","Invest in people"]},{"title":"Spiritual Wisdom","points":["Learn from others' insight","Apply wisdom practically","Think long","term"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Use worldly resources for eternal good","Wisdom in planning matters","Material wealth has spiritual implications"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"rich-fool","title":"The Rich Fool","reference":"Luke 12:16-21","theme":"wealth"},{"id":"talents","title":"The Talents","reference":"Matthew 25:14-30","theme":"stewardship"},{"id":"rich-man-and-lazarus","title":"The Rich Man and Lazarus","reference":"Luke 16:19-31","theme":"wealth use"}]},{"id":"faithful-unfaithful-servant","title":"Parable of the Faithful and Unfaithful Servant","bibleReference":{"book":"Luke","chapter":12,"verse":"41-48"},"categories":["responsibility","judgment","stewardship"],"tags":["parables of jesus","leadership","accountability"],"testament":"new","biblicalText":"Peter asked, \"Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?\"\n\nThe Lord answered, \"Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time? It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.\n\nBut suppose the servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time in coming,' and he then begins to beat the other servants, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk. The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.\n\nThe servant who knows the master's will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows. But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.\"\n\n— Luke 12:41-48 (NIV)","context":"This parable follows the Watchful Servants parable and expands on the theme of faithful service, specifically addressing those in positions of leadership and responsibility in God's kingdom.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable teaches about the responsibility that comes with spiritual knowledge and authority.

To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.\n\nThe man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.\n\nAfter a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.'\n\nHis master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'\n\nThe man with two bags of gold also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.'\n\nHis master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'\n\nThen the man who had received one bag of gold came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'\n\nHis master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.'\"\n\n— Matthew 25:14-27 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable near the end of His ministry as part of His teaching about His return and final judgment.
