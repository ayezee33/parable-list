It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them.\n\nIt will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the middle of the night or toward daybreak. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.\"\n\nâ€” Luke 12:35-40 (NIV)","context":"Jesus shared this parable while teaching His disciples about the kingdom of God and the importance of being ready for His return.
