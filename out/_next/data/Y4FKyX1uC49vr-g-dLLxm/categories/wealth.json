So he called him in and asked him, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.'\n\nThe manager said to himself, 'What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg. I know what I'll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.'\n\nSo he called in each one of his master's debtors. He asked the first, 'How much do you owe my master?' 'Nine hundred gallons of olive oil,' he replied. The manager told him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.' Then he asked the second, 'And how much do you owe?' 'A thousand bushels of wheat,' he replied. He told him, 'Take your bill and make it eight hundred.'\n\nThe master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light. I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.\"\n\n— Luke 16:1-9 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable to His disciples, teaching about the proper use of material resources. It's one of the most challenging parables to interpret, as it appears to commend dishonest behavior.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable isn't endorsing dishonesty but rather highlighting the importance of using worldly resources wisely for eternal purposes. The manager is commended not for his dishonesty but for his shrewd planning for the future, encouraging believers to be equally wise in using material resources for spiritual purposes.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Strategic Stewardship","points":["Use resources wisely","Plan for eternity","Act with foresight"]},{"title":"Kingdom Priorities","points":["Eternal perspective matters","Material wealth is temporary","Invest in people"]},{"title":"Spiritual Wisdom","points":["Learn from others' insight","Apply wisdom practically","Think long","term"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Use worldly resources for eternal good","Wisdom in planning matters","Material wealth has spiritual implications"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"rich-fool","title":"The Rich Fool","reference":"Luke 12:16-21","theme":"wealth"},{"id":"talents","title":"The Talents","reference":"Matthew 25:14-30","theme":"stewardship"},{"id":"rich-man-and-lazarus","title":"The Rich Man and Lazarus","reference":"Luke 16:19-31","theme":"wealth use"}]},{"id":"rich-fool","title":"Parable of the Rich Fool","bibleReference":{"book":"Luke","chapter":12,"verse":"16-21"},"categories":["wealth","greed","priorities"],"tags":["parables of jesus","materialism","eternal perspective"],"testament":"new","biblicalText":"And he told them this parable: \"The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. He thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.'\n\nThen he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. And I'll say to myself, \"You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.\"'\n\nBut God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?'\n\nThis is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God.\"\n\n— Luke 12:16-21 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable in response to someone who asked Him to settle an inheritance dispute. He used the opportunity to warn against all kinds of greed and the futility of finding security in material wealth.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable exposes the foolishness of living for material wealth while neglecting spiritual riches. The man's fatal flaw wasn't his wealth or success, but his self-centered focus and failure to recognize God as the source of his abundance. His life demonstrates the emptiness of pursuing wealth without eternal perspective.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"True Security","points":["Material wealth is temporary","Life is more than possessions","God is the source of real security"]},{"title":"Eternal Investment","points":["Being rich toward God matters most","Wealth brings spiritual responsibility","Tomorrow isn't guaranteed"]},{"title":"Heart Examination","points":["Check motivations for accumulating","Consider eternal implications","Practice generous stewardship"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Life's value isn't measured by possessions","Material abundance requires spiritual responsibility","Death makes earthly accumulation futile"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"rich-man-and-lazarus","title":"The Rich Man and Lazarus","reference":"Luke 16:19-31","theme":"wealth and eternity"},{"id":"hidden-treasure","title":"The Hidden Treasure","reference":"Matthew 13:44","theme":"true value"},{"id":"talents","title":"The Talents","reference":"Matthew 25:14-30","theme":"stewardship"}]},{"id":"rich-man-lazarus","title":"Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus","bibleReference":{"book":"Luke","chapter":16,"verse":"19-31"},"categories":["wealth","eternity","compassion"],"tags":["parables of jesus","judgment","stewardship"],"testament":"new","biblicalText":"\"There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. At his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.\n\nThe time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.\n\nSo he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.'\n\nBut Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.'\n\nHe answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.'\n\nAbraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.'\n\n'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.'\n\nHe said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'\"\n\n— Luke 16:19-31 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable to the Pharisees who loved money and were sneering at His teachings about wealth. It follows His teachings about faithful stewardship and the impossibility of serving both God and money.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates the eternal consequences of how we use our resources and treat others.
