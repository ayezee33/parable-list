The lioness represents the nation of Judah, and her cubs are the royal sons who became kings.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates the tragic consequences of poor leadership and rebellion against God's ways. Using the metaphor of lion cubs, it shows how pride and aggression led to Judah's princes being captured by foreign powers, fulfilling God's judgment.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Leadership Responsibility","points":["Power requires wisdom","Aggression brings consequences","Leadership affects many"]},{"title":"Pride's Downfall","points":["Strength can deceive","Violence breeds violence","Pride leads to capture"]},{"title":"National Consequences","points":["Leaders' choices affect nations","God judges leadership","Power has accountability"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Leadership carries great responsibility","Pride and violence bring judgment","God holds rulers accountable"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"cedar-tree","title":"The Cedar Tree","reference":"Ezekiel 31","theme":"pride and power"},{"id":"two-eagles","title":"The Two Eagles","reference":"Ezekiel 17","theme":"political judgment"},{"id":"vine","title":"The Vine","reference":"Ezekiel 15","theme":"divine judgment"}]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
