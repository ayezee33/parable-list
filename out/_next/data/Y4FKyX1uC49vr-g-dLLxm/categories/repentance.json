When he came to him, he said, \"There were two men in a certain town, one rich and the other poor. The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle, but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him.\n>\n> \"Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.\"\n>\n> — 2 Samuel 12:1-4 (NIV)","context":"Nathan delivered this parable to King David after David's sin with Bathsheba and the arranged death of her husband Uriah. The parable was designed to help David see his own actions through a different lens.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable was used by the prophet Nathan to confront King David about his sin with Bathsheba and against Uriah, demonstrating how God uses stories to convict hearts. The parable's power lies in its ability to bypass David's defenses and lead him to pronounce judgment on himself.","practicalApplications":[],"keyTakeaways":["God sees and judges injustice, even when committed by those in power","Self","judgment often differs from how we judge others","The role of prophetic confrontation in spiritual growth"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"unmerciful-servant","title":"The Unmerciful Servant","reference":"Matthew 18:23-35","theme":"justice and mercy"},{"id":"two-debtors","title":"The Two Debtors","reference":"Luke 7:41-43","theme":"forgiveness and self-recognition"}]},{"id":"pharisee-tax-collector","title":"Parable of the Pharisee and Tax Collector","bibleReference":{"book":"Luke","chapter":18,"verse":"9-14"},"categories":["humility","prayer","repentance"],"tags":["parables of jesus","pride","justification"],"testament":"new","biblicalText":"To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: \"Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.

The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them.\n\nNot long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.\n\nWhen he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.'\n\nSo he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.\n\nThe son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'\n\nBut the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' So they began to celebrate.\n\n— Luke 15:11-24 (NIV)","context":"This is the third and longest of Jesus' \"lost\" parables, following the Lost Sheep and Lost Coin.
