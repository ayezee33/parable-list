So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, 'For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?'\n\n'Sir,' the man replied, 'leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it. If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.'\"\n\n— Luke 13:6-9 (NIV)","context":"Jesus told this parable after discussing recent tragedies and the need for repentance. It illustrates God's patience in waiting for spiritual fruit while warning about the limits of that patience.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable reveals both God's patience and His expectation of spiritual fruitfulness. The vineyard owner represents God, the gardener represents Christ's intercession, and the fig tree represents those who have received spiritual privileges but remain unfruitful.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Divine Patience","points":["God gives time for growth","Judgment is delayed mercifully","Opportunity for repentance exists"]},{"title":"Spiritual Fruitfulness","points":["God expects results","Privileges bring responsibility","Time is limited"]},{"title":"Grace and Intervention","points":["Christ intercedes","Extra care is provided","Resources for growth given"]}],"keyTakeaways":["God's patience has purpose","Fruitlessness risks judgment","Grace provides opportunity"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"sower","title":"The Sower","reference":"Matthew 13:1-23","theme":"fruitfulness"},{"id":"vine-and-branches","title":"The Vine and Branches","reference":"John 15:1-8","theme":"productivity"},{"id":"wicked-tenants","title":"The Wicked Tenants","reference":"Matthew 21:33-46","theme":"judgment"}]},{"id":"growing-seed","title":"Parable of the Growing Seed","bibleReference":{"book":"Mark","chapter":4,"verse":"26-29"},"categories":["growth","patience","kingdom"],"tags":["parables of jesus","kingdom of heaven","spiritual growth"],"testament":"new","biblicalText":"He also said, \"This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.\n\nAll by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.\n\nAs soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.\"\n\n— Mark 4:26-29 (NIV)","context":"Jesus shared this parable alongside other agricultural parables about God's kingdom. It appears only in Mark's gospel and emphasizes the mysterious, autonomous nature of spiritual growth.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates how God's kingdom grows by divine power rather than human effort. While humans participate by sowing the seed, the actual growth process is mysterious and governed by God.

But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.\n\nThe owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?'\n\n'An enemy did this,' he replied.\n\nThe servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'\n\n'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'\"\n\n— Matthew 13:24-30 (NIV)","context":"Jesus shared this parable as part of a series of kingdom parables, teaching about the nature of God's kingdom and its development in the world.
