The pot represents Jerusalem, and its contents symbolize the people facing judgment for their corruption and violence.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates how sin's corruption requires severe cleansing. The encrusted pot represents Jerusalem's deep-seated impurity that normal cleaning cannot remove.

It was given two months before Jerusalem's fall, warning Egypt about the dangers of pride and the certainty of divine judgment.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates how pride leads to downfall. Using the metaphor of a majestic cedar tree, it shows how nations that exalt themselves will be humbled by God. The parable emphasizes God's sovereignty over all earthly powers.","practicalApplications":[{"title":"Pride's Danger","points":["Success can breed arrogance","Height precedes fall","God opposes the proud"]},{"title":"Divine Sovereignty","points":["All power comes from God","Earthly glory is temporary","God controls nations' destinies"]},{"title":"Historical Lessons","points":["Learn from others' falls","Pride blinds to danger","Humility brings stability"]}],"keyTakeaways":["Pride leads to destruction","God humbles the exalted","Power is a divine stewardship"],"relatedParables":[{"id":"two-eagles","title":"The Two Eagles","reference":"Ezekiel 17","theme":"national power"},{"id":"vine-and-branches","title":"The Vine and Branches","reference":"Ezekiel 15","theme":"divine judgment"}]},{"id":"ewe-lamb","title":"Nathan's Parable of the Ewe Lamb","bibleReference":{"book":"2 Samuel","chapter":12,"verse":"1-4"},"categories":["justice","conviction","repentance"],"tags":["nathan","david","judgment"],"testament":"old","biblicalText":"\u003e The Lord sent Nathan to David.

The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle, but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children.

The lioness represents the nation of Judah, and her cubs are the royal sons who became kings.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates the tragic consequences of poor leadership and rebellion against God's ways.

The vine represents Israel, traditionally God's chosen vineyard, now failing to produce fruit.","theologicalInterpretation":"This parable illustrates the importance of fulfilling divine purpose.
